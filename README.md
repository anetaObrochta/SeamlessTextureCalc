# SeamlessTextureCalc

# PROJECT SUMMARY

This Seamless Texture Calculator can be used by 3D designers in the apparel industry to help them resize their texture images. The problem is that when creating garments without seams, (ex. a seamless T-shirt), in a 3D software, you must first create a pattern of the garment in 2D. It will need to have a seam at the center back that will be digitally sewn. When applying texture tiles to it, the textures donâ€™t match up where the seam is, because they are not divided equally into the 2D pattern. To fix this, the image width has to be slightly resized, so that it will be able to divide up equally in the 2D pattern. This is often tedious, and a calculator would make this process much easier. I will create a calculator that will give the designer, a choice of scaling the image up or down, and the calculator will output(display) a new width dimension that can be pasted into the scale editor in the 3D program.
